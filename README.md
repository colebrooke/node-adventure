Node.js Adventure
-----------------

This is a web / text based adventure game server, written in node.js.

The database will be in MySQL.

The project is currently in _very_ early stages of development, so nothing works.

It will be heavily based on https://github.com/colebrooke/adventure.git which is written in Python with a sqlite database back end.
